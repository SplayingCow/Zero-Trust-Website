# 🏗️ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical Design Overview

## 📌 **Overview**

The **Zero Trust Website** is a **fully Rust-powered, security-first web platform** designed with **Zero Trust principles** at every layer. This document provides a detailed **technical architecture overview**, covering **backend, frontend, security, and deployment infrastructure**.

🔹 **Key Design Principles:**
- ✅ **Zero Trust Security:** No implicit trust—every request is authenticated & authorized.
- ✅ **Full Rust Implementation:** Entire stack (backend, frontend, networking) is built in Rust.
- ✅ **Sandboxed Execution:** WebAssembly (WASM) for UI security, Rust-based firewall & kernel monitoring.
- ✅ **Minimal Attack Surface:** No external dependencies, no JavaScript, secure cryptographic storage.
- ✅ **Scalability & Performance:** Custom container runtime with auto-scaling and self-healing.

## 🏗️ **System Architecture Overview**

The architecture is divided into **five main components**:

1. **Frontend:** Rust-powered UI with WebAssembly (WASM) and WebSockets.
2. **Backend:** Secure HTTP server, authentication, firewall, and database.
3. **Security Layer:** Cryptography, access control, and intrusion detection.
4. **Kernel-Level Protection:** Rust kernel module for syscall monitoring.
5. **Deployment & Infrastructure:** Secure, self-hosted, auto-scaling environment.

## 🖥️ **Backend Architecture**

The **backend** is a **custom-built Rust HTTP server** that enforces **Zero Trust security**, manages **authentication, API requests, cryptography**, and **network security policies**.

### 🔹 **Backend Components**
| Component                  | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **HTTP Server**            | Custom-built HTTP/2 & QUIC server with TLS 1.3 |
| **Router**                 | Secure routing for RESTful APIs |
| **Authentication**         | WebAuthn, FIDO2, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) |
| **Firewall**               | Blocks malicious requests (SQLi, XSS, DDoS detection) |
| **Rate Limiter**           | Prevents abuse and brute-force attacks |
| **Session Management**     | JWT & OAuth2-based stateless authentication |
| **Intrusion Detection (IDS)** | Real-time anomaly detection for API requests |
| **Database**               | Custom Rust-based encrypted key-value store |
| **Security Headers**       | Enforces strict Content Security Policy (CSP), HSTS |

### 🔹 **Zero Trust API Security**
- **Every API request is authenticated (JWT & FIDO2).**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).**
- **Rate-limiting for high-traffic endpoints to prevent DDoS attacks.**

### 🔹 **Custom Firewall & IDS**
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) for detecting malicious patterns.**
- **Blocks known attack signatures (SQL Injection, XSS, SSRF).**
- **Tamper-proof audit logging for forensics.**

## 🎨 **Frontend Architecture**

The **frontend** is a **Rust-based UI engine** with **WebAssembly (WASM)** for secure, interactive rendering.

### 🔹 **Frontend Components**
| Component                  | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Rust UI Engine**         | No JavaScript, only Rust-rendered UI |
| **HTML Renderer**          | Secure server-side rendering (SSR) |
| **Templating Engine**      | Zero Trust HTML templates (XSS-protected) |
| **WebAssembly (WASM)**     | Secure UI logic execution |
| **WebSockets**             | Real-time UI updates without JavaScript |
| **Progressive Web App (PWA)** | Offline caching, push notifications |
| **Secure Local Storage**   | Encrypted storage with WebCrypto API |

### 🔹 **Secure UI Interaction**
- **No JavaScript vulnerabilities**—all logic is executed in Rust.
- **WebSockets ensure real-time updates with backend security policies.**
- **Tamper-proof state management—preventing UI injection attacks.**

### 🔹 **WebAssembly (WASM) Security**
- **WASM isolates frontend logic execution in a sandboxed environment.**
- **Prevents unauthorized script execution (no eval(), no inline scripts).**
- **Cryptographic verification of WASM modules before execution.**

## 🔐 **Security Layer**

Security is **enforced at every layer** of the system.

### 🔹 **Cryptographic Security**
| Feature                   | Implementation |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| **Data Encryption**       | AES-GCM & ChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| **Hashing**               | SHA-256 + HMAC for integrity verification |
| **Password Storage**      | Argon2 for slow, brute-force-resistant storage |
| **Session Security**      | JWT with expiration & signature verification |
| **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**     | Enforced for inter-service communication |

### 🔹 **Zero Trust Access Control**
- **Every request is authenticated with WebAuthn & MFA.**
- **Strict RBAC/ABAC policies for fine-grained access control.**
- **All access is logged and monitored for anomalies.**

### 🔹 **Kernel-Level Security**
| Security Mechanism        | Implementation |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| **Syscall Interception**  | Blocks unauthorized system calls (ptrace, execve) |
| **Memory Protection**     | Detects buffer overflows & heap corruption |
| **Process Monitoring**    | Detects unauthorized execution attempts |
| **Zero Trust Kernel Module** | Enforces security policies at the OS level |
