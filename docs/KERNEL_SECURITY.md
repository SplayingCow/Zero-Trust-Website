# 🛡️ `KERNEL_SECURITY.md` - Zero Trust Kernel Module Security

## 📌 **Overview**

The **Zero Trust Kernel Security Module** implements **low-level system security** by **monitoring system calls, enforcing strict execution policies, and protecting memory integrity**. It is designed to prevent **privilege escalation, unauthorized process execution, and memory corruption**—critical components of **kernel exploitation defenses**.

### 🔹 **Why Kernel Security Matters in Zero Trust?**
- **Traditional security models assume the kernel is implicitly trusted**—but modern attacks exploit **syscalls, memory corruption, and privilege escalation**.
- **By enforcing Zero Trust at the kernel level,** we eliminate implicit trust and introduce strict security policies.

✅ **Key Kernel Security Features:**
- **Real-time syscall interception (execve, open, socket, kill, ptrace)**
- **Memory protection against unauthorized modifications**
- **Process monitoring to prevent privilege escalation**
- **Cryptographic logging for secure audit trails**
- **Automatic mitigation of suspicious behaviors**
- **Zero Trust policies enforced at the syscall level**

## 🏗️ **Kernel Security Components**
The kernel security module consists of **four primary components**:

1. **Syscall Interceptor** 🛑  
   - Monitors and enforces **strict security policies on system calls**.
   - Prevents **unauthorized privilege escalation attempts**.
  
2. **Memory Protection** 🔐  
   - Detects **unauthorized memory modifications** to prevent **buffer overflows and memory corruption**.
   - Implements **cryptographic page tracking** for tamper detection.
  
3. **Process Monitoring** 👀  
   - Tracks **process execution and parent-child relationships**.
   - Prevents **process injection and execution of unauthorized binaries**.

4. **Security Logging & Audit System** 📝  
   - Logs **all security events in an immutable, cryptographically signed log**.
   - Provides **detailed forensic records** for post-incident analysis.

## 🛑 **1. Syscall Interception & Enforcement**

### 🔹 **Monitored System Calls**
| **System Call**   | **Security Enforcement** |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| `execve`         | Blocks unauthorized binaries |
| `open`           | Prevents unauthorized file access |
| `socket`         | Blocks unauthorized network access |
| `ptrace`         | Prevents process injection |
| `setuid/setgid`  | Blocks unauthorized privilege escalation |
| `write /proc/mem`| Prevents direct memory tampering |

### 🔹 **Syscall Interception Example**
🛡️ **Blocking Unauthorized Syscalls**
```rust
if syscall == "ptrace" || syscall == "chmod 777" {
    println!("[SECURITY] BLOCKED: Unauthorized syscall '{}' detected!", syscall);
    return false;
}
```
🚨 **Impact:**
- Blocks **debuggers and malware** from hijacking system processes.
- Prevents **suspicious execution** of potentially malicious binaries.

---

## 🔐 **2. Memory Protection**
Memory attacks such as **buffer overflows, heap spraying, and stack corruption** are among the most dangerous exploits.

### 🔹 **Implemented Memory Security Controls**
| **Protection Mechanism** | **Function** |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Cryptographic page tracking** | Detects unauthorized memory modifications |
| **Heap integrity monitoring** | Detects heap corruption |
| **Canary-based buffer overflow detection** | Prevents stack smashing attacks |
| **Execution control** | Blocks execution of modified memory regions |

### 🔹 **Memory Integrity Check Example**
🛡️ **Detecting Memory Tampering**
```rust
if original_memory_snapshot != &current_memory_snapshot {
    println!("[SECURITY] Memory corruption detected in '{}'", process);
}
```
🚨 **Impact:**
- Detects and **halts execution of compromised memory pages**.
- Prevents **code injection, shellcode execution, and privilege escalation**.

---

## 👀 **3. Process Monitoring**
Process-based attacks such as **process injection and privilege escalation** are common in **rootkits and malware**.

### 🔹 **Zero Trust Process Enforcement**
| **Attack Type** | **Mitigation** |
|---------------|--------------|
| **Unauthorized process execution** | Blocks untrusted binaries |
| **Process injection attempts** | Prevents ptrace-based attacks |
| **Privilege escalation detection** | Blocks `setuid` & `execve` attacks |
| **Parent-child process tracking** | Prevents process masquerading |

### 🔹 **Process Execution Check Example**
🛡️ **Detecting Suspicious Process Execution**
```rust
if process == "malicious_binary" {
    println!("[SECURITY] Unauthorized process execution detected: '{}'", process);
}
```
🚨 **Impact:**
- Blocks **malicious scripts, trojans, and rootkits** from executing.
- Prevents **unauthorized privilege escalation**.

---

## 📝 **4. Security Logging & Forensics**
All security events are **logged in an immutable, cryptographically signed log**.

### 🔹 **What is Logged?**
✅ **All system call invocations**  
✅ **Blocked unauthorized execution attempts**  
✅ **Privilege escalation attempts**  
✅ **Memory modification alerts**  

### 🔹 **Tamper-Proof Log Example**
```rust
let log_entry = format!(
    "[SECURITY LOG] {} | Process: {} | Event: {}",
    timestamp, process, event
);
println!("{}", log_entry);
```

🚨 **Impact:**
- **Forensic visibility** into all security events.
- **Detects anomalous patterns** before exploitation occurs.
